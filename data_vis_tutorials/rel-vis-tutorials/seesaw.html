  <h2>How to use this:</h2>

<p>On the left, in the 'About you' section of this page, you can set the sliders and drop-down menus according to your personal information. On the right, the picture of the seesaw is interactive (you can play around by dragging on the blue indicators or the blue goal ball).</p>

<p>Initially, the food indicator (pictured with a hamburger) shows how many calories you can eat without exercising to stay at the same current weight. This number is the minimum number of calories you need to stay healthy each day. It is equal to (BMR x Activity Factor), as this number is a good basis for a healthy amount of calories consumed daily, it is fixed as the minimum amount of calories consumed in this model.</p>

<p>The exercise indicator (below the food indicator) shows zero calories to start with. The goal ball on the right shows your current weight, and the seesaw is level.</p>

<p>If you drag up or down on the exercise indicator, you can see how much you could potentially weigh, within the goal ball, assuming you kept exercising off that many calories each day.</p>

<p>You can also drag  the food indicator up and down, adding or subtracting calories to or from your daily diet. As you adjust the food indicator (calories in), and the exercise indicator (calories out), you can see how your weight will change in the goal ball.</p>

<p>The goal ball shows how much you will weigh at a point in time in the future. Below the goal ball is a projected calendar, if you drag the goal ball right or left, you will see the affect of time on your weight, according to the calories in and out that you've set.</p>

<p>Any time one of the choices on the left (under the 'About You' section) changes, the seesaw resets itself, except for the goal date.</p>

<h2>How this works:</h2>

<p>This application uses a variety of SVG elements, most of which we've covered previously: drawing elements, dragging, dynamic text. They just might be slightly modified.</p>

<p>One new feature is hiding and showing elements.  If you drag the goal weight ball left or right, you will be able to see how much you will weigh at a future date. Actually, the calendar has all of the dates, and all but one is hidden. But not all the dates are shown, just the one you drag to.</p>

<p>There are two approaches to doing something like this. The first approach is to set the element's opacity attribute to 0, initially, until you mouse over it. In the event that you mouse over the element, you can then change the opacity attribute, or the color, or even call another function. The following assumes you have a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> in your html file with <code>id="myDiv"</code>.</p>

<pre><code>  var calD = new Array();
  var d=new Date();     //d holds today's date
  var numberOfDays = 5;
  var space = 10;       //10 pixels between each date
  var calX=10;
  var calY=300;

  paper.rect(calX,calY,10,10).attr({fill:'red'});   
  //create a box so you know where to hover over

  for(var i=0;  i&lt;numberOfDays; i++){      
    calD[i]=paper.text(calX+(space*i), calY ,d.getDate());
    calD[i].attr({opacity:0, 'font-size':24});

    calD[i].mouseover(function(){ this.attr({opacity:1});  });
    calD[i].mouseout(function(){  this.attr({opacity:0});      })

    d.setDate(d.getDate()+1);
  }
</code></pre>

<p>In the above code, as you mouse over each element, it appears, and when your mouse is not over it, it becomes invisible again. You can do this with anything (rectangles, circles, shapes, text), any element that can be created that has an <code>opacity</code> attribute in Raphael.</p>

<p>Another approach is to hide SVG elements by appending <code>.hide()</code> to the element name. When you want to show that element again, append <code>.show()</code> to the element name.</p>

<p>To get the calendar dates on the bottom, we used a for-loop, which printed out all of the dates and put them to an array. To access each date individually, we can call each date if we know the index.</p>

<pre><code>  var calendarDate = new Array();
  var d=new Date(); //d holds today's date
  var numberOfDays = 10;
  var space = 10;       //10 pixel between each date
  var calendarX = 10;
  var calendarY = 200;

  for(var i=0;  i&lt;numberOfDays; i++){
      calendarDate[i]=paper.text(calendarX+(space*i), calendarY ,d.getDate());      
      calendarDate[i].hide();
      calendarDate[i].mouseover(function(){
                this.attr('fill','red');
                someFunction();
      });
    d.setDate(d.getDate()+1);   //adds one day to the variable d
  }
    calendarDate[0].show();
    calendarDate[2].show();
    calendarDate[4].show();
</code></pre>

<p>This approach is a little bit trickier. In the example immediately above, we decided to show the elements with the indices [0], [2], [4]. This is to indicate how you would show an element you've previously hidden with the <code>.show()</code> function. In our seesaw, those numbers were replaced with a variable in the code, which was updated as you dragged on the goal ball.  Like this:</p>

<pre><code>  calendarDate[dynamicVariable].show();
</code></pre>

<p>Additionally, this example shows that you can change other attributes (like changing the text color to red), on a mouseover event. You can also notice that when you mouseover one of the elements, it will call the function <code>someFunction()</code>, which can be programmed elsewhere.</p>

<p>For the most part, the interactive elements of this seesaw have been covered previously in the other tutorials. The food and exercise indicators are programmed similarly to our <a href="http://staging.dubberly.com/michelle/110927-SVG_Relationship_Visualizations/Relationship_Visualizations/move-resize-svg">Drag/Resize SVG</a> demonstration, and how to code the dynamic text can be found on the <a href="mortgage-calc.html">Mortgage calculator</a> page. The tutorial on tying the sliders on the left hand side to JavaScript can be found on the <a href="area-calc-slider.html">Area Visualizer | Sliders</a> page.</p>
