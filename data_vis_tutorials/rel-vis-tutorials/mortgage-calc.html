    <p>The chart on the right shows the advantage of paying extra each month. If you pay $<span class="extraMonthyPayment">100</span> each month, you'll save $<span class="extraTotalSavings"></span> and pay back your loan in <span class="extraFinishedIn"></span> years.</p>

    <p>The bar graph shows the composition of your payments in each year of the loan. In the beginning you pay much more interest than principal. As the term of the loan goes on the ratio inverts.</p>
  </div>


<p>There are actually two canvases here, one for the pie charts and another for the bar graph.</p>

<p>Similar to our slider application, the SVG elements on this page are constantly being wiped clear, then redrawn with new coordinates. To begin, declare a couple <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> sections and assert id's on them so that we can have canvases to work with.</p>

<p>In addition to the Rapha&#235;l JavaScript library of functions that help manipulate SVG elements, Rapha&#235;l also has a library dedicated to making graphs, called gRapha&#235;l. The pie charts above are a result of this library.</p>

<p>The library and information can be downloaded and viewed at their website.</p>

<h2 id="pie-chart-head">Pie Chart</h2>

<p>To draw a pie chart using the gRapha&#235;l library, download and include the following files into your webpage file:</p>

<ul>
<li>raphael.js</li>
<li>g.raphael.js (12 Kb)</li>
<li>g.pie.js</li>
</ul>


<p>The standard pie chart is straightforward to set up. However, you can modify the g.pie.js file so that your chart has more features.</p>

<p>For example, one of our pie graphs' colors are translucent. In order to achieve this, a new attribute (opacity) needs to be added to the g.pie.js file. Specifically, line 56. Which is:</p>

<pre><code>var p = this.path(opts.init ? ipath : path).attr({
  fill: opts.colors &amp;&amp; opts.colors[i] || this.g.colors[i] ||"#666",
  stroke: opts.stroke || "#fff", 
  "stroke-width": (opts.strokewidth == null ? 1 : opts.strokewidth), 
  "stroke-linejoin": "round" 
});
</code></pre>

<p>This bit of code determines which attributes the programmer can change via the function call. If we add an attribute for opacity to this list, we can then change the opacity of our pie chart when we draw it.</p>

<p>The modified code:</p>

<pre><code>var p = this.path(opts.init ? ipath : path).attr({
  fill: opts.colors &amp;&amp; opts.colors[i] || this.g.colors[i] ||"#666",
  stroke: opts.stroke || "#fff", 
  "stroke-width": (opts.strokewidth == null ? 1 : opts.strokewidth), 
  "stroke-linejoin": "round", 
  "fill-opacity":opts.opacity[i]
});
</code></pre>

<p>now, when we call the method, we can pass in values for opacity:</p>

<pre><code>var myPie = pie.g.piechart(
  X,
  Y, 
  radius, 
  [principleAmount/total, interest/total],
  {colors:[principleColor, interestColor], 
  opacity:[.4,.4]
  }
);
</code></pre>

<p>Additionally, it was necessary to remove the sorting algorithm. The standard code for drawing this, automatically places the larger piece of the pie on the top, which was inconvenient for our purposes, since that meant the colors would suddenly switch, as numbers would recalculate. To remedy this, the method <code>.sort()</code> had to be removed from the pie chart function. (Line 46-48).</p>

<p>The values of the principle and interest change on the charts as you vary the loan amount, down payment, interest rate, etc. The labels on the chart reflect those changes each time one of the above variables are changed.</p>

<p>Since the pie chart is being redrawn each time a new calculation occurs, this number change happens because a variable is passed into the declaration for the labels each time.</p>

<p>For example, instead of:</p>

<pre><code>pie.text(xLocation, yLocation, "$25000");
</code></pre>

<p>We write:</p>

<pre><code>pie.text(xLocation, yLocation, "$"+total);
</code></pre>

<p>So <code>total</code>, a previously declared variable, will constantly update the number fields and be relevant, instead of passing just '$25000' which is a static number. As the page renders, the variable <code>total</code> will be accurate each time.</p>

<h2>Bar Graph</h2>

<p>The bar graph is not a part of Rapha&#235;l's JavaScript library. The method to draw the bar graph involves a for-loop, which loops as many times as there are years. On each iteration of the for-loop, two rectangles are created (one for principle, one for interest). These rectangles are placed stacked vertically on the canvas, with about 2 pixels separating them.</p>

<p>A variable which holds the starting coordinates for the next newly created element is offset each time the loop iterates, so that eventually the rectangles takes on a familiar image of a bar graph, and it's evident what's happening throughout the years of your loan.</p>

<p>The last caveat of this bar graph is its ability to be contained in a fixed area. To achieve this, before working with the principle amount and interest amount numbers, you must divide them by the desired height of your graph, then pass those quotients into the <code>.rect()</code> method as heights. Similarly, you must divide the number of years by the desired length of your fixed graph (and pass that quotient into the length of your <code>.rect()</code> method ), since the rectangle sizes are direct reflections of those numbers.</p>
